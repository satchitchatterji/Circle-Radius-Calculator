# Circle-Radius-Calculator
Calculates radius of circle given three points, and optional calibration in terms of centimeters.

Can be used, for example, to find the radius of a cloud chamber particle trail and figure out local magnetic field. NOTE: That purpose would need a large reference image to ensure accuracy.
